** Contributing
   Please do. Open an issue or a pull request if you need a snippet added, want to discuss
   changing a key binding, or have any issues.

   I know I didn't get to all of them, and there are some I intentionally left off, but I'm 
   to adding or changing almost all of these.

   - [ ] Shorter bindings. If I can figure out there won't be clashed with the other JavaScript
     Yasnippets, I would like to shorten some of these key bindings.
   - [ ] Full coverage for EcmaScript 2015
   - [ ] MELPA package
